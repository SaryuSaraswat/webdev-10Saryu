Objective: Understand the difference between block-level and inline-level tags.

Using Block-Level Tags

Create a new HTML file named block-vs-inline.html.

Define the basic structure of an HTML document.

Inside the body tag, add three div tags with the content "Block 1", "Block 2", and "Block 3".
Using Inline-Level Tags
Below the block-level tags, add a p tag with the content "This is an example of using " followed by three span tags with the content "inline ", "elements ", and "in a paragraph".

Mixing Block and Inline Tags
Below the inline-level tags, add a div tag.
Inside the <div> tag, add a p tag with the content "This is a block-level element containing an inline " followed by a <span> tag with the content "element".
Observing Display Differences
Add CSS styles to differentiate block and inline elements.
Inside the <head> tag, add a <style> tag.
Add styles to give a border to <div> and <span> tags to visualize their differences.
Set the div border to "1px solid black" and span border to "1px dotted red".
